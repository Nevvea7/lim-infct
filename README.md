# Limited Infection Visualization

## The Program

Many thanks to d3.js, especially [this example] [http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045]

### Generate Random Acyclic Graph

- Every time the page loads, it would generate a group of graphs that contains 150 nodes in total

### Total Infection

- Click on any node to invoke Total Infection

### Limited Infection

- Put a number in the "max infected" box and hit "Lim Infect" to invoke Limited Infection
- If involved groups were on different versions before limited infection starts, they should be on the same, highest version after being infected together
